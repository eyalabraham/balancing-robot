 avr-control.c

 * this program is the control program for a 2-wheel balancing robot.
 * the robot is managed by a RaspberryPi connected to an ATmega328P,
 * which runs this code.
 * the AVR performs 2 tasks:
 * AVR: (1) read MPU-6050 sensor
 *      (2) compute PID, and control motors
 *      (3) process commands coming from RPi
 *
 * RPi: send commands to AVR for changing PID constants and getting status
